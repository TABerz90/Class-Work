# Class-Work
This is my compilation of all the codes that I deem are important in our class. If you have suggestions for any other code that I may have missed lemme know.
Additionally, I can also add PSUEDOCODE DOCS of each of these codes that I write in case that makes it easier for all of us.

NOTE: All of these are in python. I have added Notes to each code so those who do VB can understand what is going on in here.

# Updates
I am hoping to add Visual Basic files of some of the codes here. For that I need some collaborators who can help me with it.
